## What is Product Leadership and what skills do you need to be a successful Product Leader?

I have published the following materials to help product managers working at all levels to get better at what we do, and to learn and develop:

## Defining 'Product Leadership'

The Digital Data and Technology (DDaT) Capability Framework describes the role and skills you need to be a Product Manager, across 5 role levels; Associate Product Manager, Product Manager, Senior Product Manager, Lead Product Manager, Head of Product.
[DDaT Capability Framework] (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework#product-and-delivery:-product-manager) 

We define Product Leadership as anyone in a Senior Product Manager, Lead Product Manager or Head of Product role.
In our experience, Senior Product Manager is often the first role where a product manager is asked to own a vision and strategy for multiple products, take on line-management activities, and engage and communicate with a larger group of more senior stakeholders.

**We assume that a successful Product Leader has already developed strong product management skills and been a successful Product Manager.**

## Key skills for successful Product Leaders

We have defined four additional skills which we expect Product Leaders to develop:

* develop and manage product people
* define portfolio vision and strategy
* understand your organisation
* participate in executive management teams

Each skill has an example set of activities and experiences which add detail and provide tangible examples. You can read the complete list below.

## How to use the Product Leadership skills and supporting materials

This list helps Product Leaders to take greater ownership over their personal development, and gives practical examples of the things we expect a successful Product Leader to be able to do.

As well as using the skills to help guide personal and professional development, you can also use them in your local product management community and networks, as the basis for group discussions or workshops.

The list **is not** intended to be prescriptive, or a test of ability. **It is** intended to be a guiding framework to support Product Leaders to become the best [#ProductPeople] (https://twitter.com/hashtag/productpeople) that they can be, support other Product Managers in their organisation, and deliver world-class products and services.
